Instructions

Write a function that takes an int min and an int max as parameters. The function must return a slice of ints with all the values between min and max.

Min is included, and max is excluded.

If min is greater than or equal to max, a nil slice is returned.

append is not allowed for this exercise.

Expected function

func MakeRange(min, max int) []int {

}
Usage

Here is a possible program to test your function :

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"piscine"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(piscine.MakeRange(5, 10))
	fmt.Println(piscine.MakeRange(10, 5))
}
And its output :

$ go run .
[5 6 7 8 9]
[]
$
